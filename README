to install Django on your machine you need to run this simple steps:

mkdir ~/src

cd ~/src

wget http://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.3.1/tarball/ -O django.tar

tar xvf django.tar

cd Django-1.3.1

python setup.py install --home=~

Since we are installing into a non-standard location we will need to set the PYTHONPATH env variable:

export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/lib/python

export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH

Now verify that Django is installed and the right version is in your path:

python

>>> import django

>>> print django.get_version()
1.3.1

and there you go, you have successfully installed Django on your computer.

to start a new project simply type

django-admin.py startproject 'name of the project without quotation marks ('')'
